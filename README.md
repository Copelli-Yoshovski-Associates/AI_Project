## Artificial Intelligence Driven Java Game: Color Pop
This project showcases the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) with Java development, utilizing JavaFX GUI, the MVC pattern, and Answer Set Programming (ASP) logic. The game is powered by the EmbASP framework, developed by the University of Calabria (Unical).

## Used Technologies
- Java
- JavaFX

(a project of the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science of the University of Calabria)

## What is Answer Set Programming (ASP)?
Answer Set Programming is form of declarative logic programming oriented at finding solutions to complete decision problems. 
It can handle data incompleteness by formulating logical rules based on the deductive reasoning process. To witness the power of 
Answer Set Programming (ASP) in tackling complex scenarios, such as those encountered in humanitarian assistance, 
explore [Stefan Yoshovski](https://github.com/yoshovski)'s research work on an ASP-based system for humanitarian assistance.
Check out the Thesis-ASP-Based-System-For-Humanitarian-Assistance repository for a comprehensive understanding of how 
ASP can be leveraged to address critical challenges in this domain.

## ASP Encoding
To understand the ASP encoding employed in the Color Pop project, 
please refer to the [encoding files](https://github.com/Copelli-Yoshovski-Associates/ColorPop_AI_Project/blob/main/ColorPop/encodings/asp2.dlv). 
This encoding provides insights into the fascinating logic and rules governing the game mechanics.
